## Briefly about the project

This is a memory game with our mentors’ avatars.

## How to play

You need to memorize what was the order of displayed pictures but do not forget the time is running and your points are getting smaller  and smaller sec by sec, so don’t waste your time.
New pictures come at the upper left corner level by level. You must drag a picture from the tray below and drop it into the proper slot to build up the correct order. If you’re done, click on the “Check solution” button for checking and finishing the current level. After that you have checked your attempt, you can click on the “Next Level” button so that you get the next level’s picture.
